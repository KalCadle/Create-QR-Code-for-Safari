If you're looking for a convenient way to share web tabs from your iOS device to other devices that don't support Apple's AirDrop or other built in sharing options, this Siri Shortcut might be helpful.  This shortcut allows you to generate a temporary QR code for sharing a web page to another device by scanning the code with your other device's camera.  Once you've scanned the QR code to share it to the other device, you can tap either done or cancel to discard the QR code.

To use this Siri Shortcut, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the Shortcut.  You can install the Siri Shortcut from this link: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1909da0db9ba4e10a4faa0a8606abd5a
2. Once you've installed the shortcut, tap the circular button with 3 dots on it on the top right corner of the shortcut in the Shortcuts app.
3. Tap the Information button.
4. Tap "Show in Share Sheet".
5. Now the shortcut will be available in the share sheet, so you can open the share sheet, select the new "Create QR Code" shortcut, and it will generate a QR code for the web page you have open.

This shortcut has only been tested on iOS 17 and iPadOS 17.  I don't see any reason why it wouldn't run on earlier versions of iOS or iPadOS, but I have not tested it on earlier versions, so I cannot guarantee it will work without issues.
